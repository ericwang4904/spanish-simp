“The ideal use of these medications is only as needed, so I would say about two or three times a week, limited to a short period of time,” said Dr. Alcibiades Rodriguez, a sleep medicine expert at NYU Langone Health.  When should you use sleeping pills?  There are situations where using sleeping pills judiciously could be helpful, like during a two- or three-week bout of insomnia triggered by a specific event. A doctor may also recommend sleeping pills as a last resort if you’ve failed to get restful sleep after trying lifestyle changes, such as avoiding screens at night, and cognitive behavioral therapy tactics designed specifically for sleep.  You should always consult with a health provider before you start taking sleep medication so you can make a plan for how long you’re going to take the pills. If you still need them after one month, talk to a doctor to determine if another treatment or medication would work better or to see if you have a condition that is contributing to your poor sleep and can’t be addressed with any sleeping pills.  What works for you will depend on the cause of your insomnia, Dr. Neubauer said. Rozerem works by stimulating the brain’s melatonin receptor to help you maintain a normal sleep cycle. Doctors sometimes prescribe drugs called benzodiazepines, which can both reduce anxiety and make you drowsy, if you have trouble falling asleep. These include alprazolam (Xanax) and clonazepam (Klonopin). There are also non-benzodiazepine drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien) and eszopiclone (Lunesta), that can produce similar effects.  How bad is it to take sleeping pills every night?  Over-the-counter antihistamines haven’t been well studied for their effects on sleep, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against using them for insomnia. Many can linger in your system and cause daytime grogginess and falls. Long-term use can carry the risk of memory problems, confusion and constipation, all of which may be more pronounced in older adults. Some studies have suggested long-term antihistamine use is associated with increased dementia risk, though the link is not definitive.
